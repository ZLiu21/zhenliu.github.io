## About Me
I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Ph.D. at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), under the mentorship of Professor [Qianli Ma](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/qianlima/). My research is centered around deep learning, specifically focusing on **time series classification**, **time series pre-training**, **semi-supervised learning**,  **label noise learning**, and **incomplete data analysis**.
